    <h1 @click="essay1 = ! essay1"> What is a Company? </h1>
    <div x-show="essay1">
      <p>My two sons and I had just left home in the car. We were talking about the other cars on the road around us, and I mentioned that they had all been created by companies. There was a logo on each car to indicate the company that made them. We drove along spotting Toyotas and Audis, Mazdas and Mitsubishis.</p>
      <p>Then my four year old son said, "Papa, what is a company?".</p>
      <p>From my years back in business school, I knew that there were well formed responses to this question. But I also went to design school, and to my surprise I found that designers have an interesting take on creating a company.</p>
      <p>Here is what happened.</p>
      <p>I was heading into my final year of design school and heard of a new lecturer soon to arrive. A Brazilian man named Charles Bezerra.</p>
      <p>Charles was unassuming. He had an expression of curiosity, and way of conversation that indicated he really listened.</p>
      <p>He had been a professor at one of the top design schools in the world. One that worked at the intersection of design and business. The Illinois Institute of technology based in Chicago.</p>
      <p>Charles became my honours supervisor. And what I learned from him would influence what I would explore for the rest of my life.</p>
      <p>Designers focus on form and function, understanding physical materials, environmental factors, and the nature and behaviour of people. It turned out that a company could be thought of as a group of people shaped by practices, environments and technology. All of which could be designed.</p>
      <p>A designer starts with those they serve, and anchored there, they get comfortable with the openness and unknowns that follow. This struck me as  different to what I heard in business school. In business school you learn a lot of 'best practices'. These are known, battle tested ways to build a business in a competitive market. In design school you learn to build things from scratch, you start with the people you want to serve, and then explore their lives from there.  You don't know yet where it will lead.</p>
      <p>In regards to a building company, the difference of approach between design and business school drives to the heart of what a company is, and what it becomes. Business school teaches to create in terms of business models, markets and industries. Design school teaches to create in terms of humanity, history and environment.</p>
      <p>This brings me back to my son's question: "what is a company?"</p>
      <p>A business school response would be along the lines of this. "A company is a group of people who work together to create things that people buy, they compete against other companies and make money from being the best at what they do, for people and for the environment."</p>
      <p>While I drew a lot from business school, I found myself responding primarily from my formation in design school.</p>
      <p>I said, "Buddy, a company is a group of people who serve together. They think deeply about the people they serve, noticing their lives, their environment,  their hopes and needs. All these things help them know what to create."</p>
      <p>My son listened to what I said and simply responded, "Ok Papa".  And as we continued on our way we discussed the design decisions that had been made by these company's who were serving these drivers.</p>

    <h1 @click="essay2 = ! essay2"> What is a Service? </h1>
    <div x-show="essay2">
      <p>There is a story told in Christian tradition of a time when a man named Jesus did a small act that was surprising for his time and culture.</p>
      <p>Jesus was born in the Middle East in obscurity, but has now set the modern western calendar of BC and AD. He is understood by Christians as part of the character of God, a complex being who has formed all reality as we know it. So for Christians, the actions of this man are important.</p>
      <p>Jesus was an Israelite Rabbi, a respected teacher of his time. Rabbis would travel and teach with a group of people known as their disciples. A Rabbi would hold a certain status in the community and therefore would be treated with honour.</p>
      <p>On this day the group had been travelling on dusty Israeli roads and it was evening. They had been wearing open sandals and it was time to clean their feet after the journey. Typically the Rabbi would have someone clean his feet, but today was different. Jesus took up a towel and bowl and went around the disciples cleaning their feet.</p>
      <p>This story not only reveals a constant theme in the actions of Jesus over his life, but for Christians it reveals something of the character of God, and is therefore reflected in humanity who were designed to image Him.</p>
      <p>Service is core to the human condition.</p>
      <p>But what is service?</p>
      <p>I think we know it when we see it, service being that focus on others, a care for them, their lives and situation. It is helping them in what they need.</p>
      <p>Where things get a little more complicated is when people serve together. With a growing group there are multiple people now with multiple needs to be served. Not only are there different needs now in the people being served, but also those that are serving have needs.</p>
      <p>The simple act of service to another person can get lost with a growing number of people serving together. In a community group, a company, a church, a government department.</p>
      <p>For example, a modern company can involve many people beyond the customers that have needs to serve: the team, the families of the team, the shareholders of the company, and the community in which they operate. Often the needs of these different groups seem to be in opposition.</p>
      <p>Does the outward nature of service need to turn inward as the group of people serving grows? As more groups are added have needs to serve, is this where the focus must shift?</p>
      <p>There are a couple of things that can help this gravity of turning inward: firstly, a memory of the simple act of service that existed in the beginning, and secondly a commitment to redesign any part of how the group works to orient back toward service.</p>
      <p>Firstly, as a group grows it is very easy to forget the simple act of service that existed in the beginning. There was a need, there was a way that helped that need. The group grew due to that need. Come back to that need, that simple story of service. Play it out over time, see how everything works together now in service to those with that need.</p>
      <p>Secondly, as a group grows there are new needs that emerge from the different people that join in the serving. It is easy to lose the sense of why the group existed in the first place with all these new people and needs. This requires constant redesign of how the service looks. Go back to the simple story of service from the beginning, orient every aspect of the group to that end.</p>
      <p>Start with the original need and service. Then in light of this, think about how people join in the serving in a way that enhances that service? Think about how they get paid in a way that enhances the original service? How the group makes money to sustain the service? How it shares money? How people grow in their skills? How what the group does changes over time? All of these needs can be served, but design it all to enhance the original service.</p>
      <p>For example, a cafe starts with the simple act of making a good cup of coffee for someone. This act of service can be improved with better equipment, and a price can be set so that you can continue to make cups of coffee based on what people can afford. Other people can join your act of service and offer addition things like good baking and other drink options. A space can be created to enjoy these things, and all could be financially sustained through prices that work for those you serve. All of these things can work together to enhance that simple act of service of making someone a cup of coffee, and what that coffee means for their day.</p>
      <p>Service is an ongoing effort, there will be more needs to serve over time. But it is all service. And you can serve, it is what started it all in the first place.</p>
      <p>A simple act of service.</p>

    <h1 @click="essay3 = ! essay3"> What is this world we live in? </h1>
    <div x-show="essay3">
      <p>I have two sons and I treasure them dearly. My oldest is currently five, and youngest just turned three.</p>
      <p>As a father there are so many books and discussions about the many things that we can teach our children. What is a bit less talked about is how much they teach us.</p>
      <p>For many years I have held an underlying assumption that in order to live well in the world, we must understand the world. The more we know about the world, the more we will know what to do in it.</p>
      <p>My boys have taught me something a bit different.</p>
      <p>They don't yet know a lot about how this world works, but they do something incredibly sophisticated in their way they navigate it.</p>
      <p>They rely on those around them.</p>
      <p>My youngest will do this in the simplest way. When he is doing something, he'll just look over at me and get a sense of my response to what he is doing. This is not too dissimilar to getting an expert opinion on a company strategy, or a healthcare expert report to guides government policy.</p>
      <p>We all rely on others to live in this world, I think we can just forget this as we become more confidence in our growing knowledge. Our curiosity drives us to understand so many things about the world as we grow older. But somewhere along the line, us modern westerners can start to buy into the idea that we are isolated individuals that can navigate the world on our own understanding.</p>
      <p>We can view children as simple and unsophisticated. Their simple faith in others a sign of immaturity and weakness. But what if it was a sign of strength? What if we ourselves were actually drawing from faith in the views of others to make decisions in life also. What if we just forgot which viewpoints we were trusting as we make our decisions?</p>
      <p>I find that my boys are naturally curious about the world, they ask questions and they explore. They do all this in relationship with my wife and I, and also with other people that they are starting to meet and know.</p>
      <p>They love discovering the world around them, they are drawn into it. I find myself getting caught up in their love of this world. Discovering the nature and patterns of volcanoes, through to the different designs of rocket engines.</p>
      <p>It is love that draws them into the world around them, and faith in the views of those with them that holds them. Then as they come to know more of what interests them, hope forms as new possibilities open up.</p>
      <p>As they explore the unknowns, new unknowns reveal themselves. But they don't seem to be deterred by these unknowns. The unknowns aren't to be feared, by explored.</p>
      <p>Love draws them on.</p>
      <p>They naturally create, they play, they form new things with what they know. This could be an airplane they create from a few pieces of cardboard, then with lego, then start to explore how they can get it to actually fly.</p>
      <p>There are possibilities all around us.</p>
      <p>This world is a gift to explore and enjoy.</p>
      <p>But there are also dangers and very really challenges to face head on. The world is a complex place. There are many unknowns, possibilities, hurts and pain.</p>
      <p>But there is just something about my boys that seems to be part of a natural response children have to this world.</p>
      <p>They trust people, they find things to discover, and create with what they have.</p>
      <p>I get to see all this from the vantage point of a father.</p>
      <p>In the Christian tradition, the story is told of a conversation between Jesus and his followers. The questioned is asked to Jesus how we should talk with God. Jesus begins his answer by framing the nature of the relationship we can have with God: “Our Father in heaven…”</p>
      <p>God is understood in Christian tradition as the creator and sustainer of all reality. He has created humanity in His image. His children that join Him in the ongoing creation of the universe. Creating cities, technologies, and exploring unknowns.</p>
      <p>There are many unknowns, but in the Christian traditional, that's ok.</p>
      <p>We're children, with a Father.</p>

    <h1 @click="essay4 = ! essay4"> What could be done with a simple note app? </h1>
    <div x-show="essay4">
      <p>I'm building a note app with a friend called Nat. It's a little different than other note apps you may have tried. The note app is called Hunch, and it's built from a small fragile idea.</p>
      <p>You could say it's just a hunch.</p>
      <p>Here it is: "little things are as important as big things."</p>
      <p>We tend to value big things, a successful product, school, business, church, movement, country. These things are beyond us, bigger than what we can hold alone. These things take groups of people to participate, and we value the people who appear to have control over the big thing.</p>
      <p>But what about little things? A conversation, an interesting idea, a beautiful cup of coffee, something noticed on a walk. Are the big things more important than these little things?</p>
      <p>Maybe you can't separate the big things from the little things, because it's the little things that make up the big things.</p>
      <p>But we seem separate big from little.</p>
      <p>We think that big things like a company or country aren't actually made up of little things: people, conversations, moments and spaces.</p>
      <p>Little things are as important as big things because they make up big things.</p>
      <p>But even if we intuitively know the big things are made up of little things, we can struggle to connect the two. There are so many moments, places and people in the big things we just can hold it all. We can't traverse all the little things without losing the woods for the trees.</p>
      <p>Well, when we can't hold the little things we actually lose hold of the big things. We make collective decisions about our companies, churches, culture and countries without a connection to the actual little things that ground us.</p>
      <p>So I have a hunch, that the little things are as significant as the big things and we must hold the big things together with the little things to think clearly about our world and life together.</p>
      <p>To hold little with big we need at least a couple of capabilities. First we need to be able to zoom, second to be able to reframe.</p>
      <p>We need the ability to zoom from little to big and back. The importance of the little thing makes sense in light of the big thing, and vice versa.</p>
      <p>We also need the ability to reframe. Little things can be framed up into big things by different people in different ways depending on what they notice and value. The ongoing interaction between people and their different framing of the little things is important to the life and health of a community and culture.</p>
      <p>It is very difficult to zoom and reframe the little things in such a complex and dynamic world as the one we all live in. Historically we can used tools to extend our capability to handle complex tasks. The tool of language, the tool of writing.</p>
      <p>This is where Hunch helps.</p>
      <p>Hunch is a tool.</p>
      <p>It is a tool to help people hold the little details and the big picture, to zoom and reframe together. To appreciate the details of life while also appreciating the majestic nature of our collective activity.</p>
      <p>Little things are as important as big things.</p>
      <p>It's from the little beginnings that big things emerge, a noticing of something, a reflection.</p>
      <p>It's in the little things that people come together to form ideas and create. Creation is a meeting place, and if freedom is given to frame and reframe, these early moments can be precious, and little things don't die.</p>
      <p>Little things take time to grow, and they can come from anywhere.</p>
      <p>The world is bountiful with little things to notice and treasure, it is a gift for us to enjoy together. To share and create from.</p>
      <p>As we treasure the little things, we come to see new connections, to notice new ways to see the world, new things grow, big things emerge.</p>
      <p>Little things are as important as big things.</p>
      <p>That's my hunch.</p>
